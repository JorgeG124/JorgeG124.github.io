## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

Lab 1
This lab is one of my favorites for obvious reasons. I have not had any previous experience with coding before this class so the very first lab introduced me to a whole new world. This very simple lab was hard at the moment but looking back and realizing I've come a long way from that and can understand harder code.

Lab 4, part 2
This lab was fun because we began to use input given by the user and secret numbers. I had to figure out how to use if else loops which was a little confusing but once I did the game created by the code was fun to play. I thought it was really cool that we can create games from simple code.

Lab 8, part 2
This lab was really intriguing because we got to use loops in a different and interesting way. We had to use for loops which were still a little challenging but we did get the hang of it. The output of the overall code was really cool and thought provoking when it comes to what other patterns could be made.
